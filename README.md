  Developed to streamline the health records of animals, the platform allows easy tracking of vaccinations, deworming, and veterinary appointments.
  It facilitates the management and treatment of chronic diseases, preventing the loss of records and ensuring continuity of treatment during changes 
  in location or veterinarians, and even in cases of lost vaccination cards.

Owners can create individual profiles for each of their animals, adding important reminders. Additionally, they have access to a search for veterinarians 
registered on the platform, being able to favorite them and add them to the profile.
